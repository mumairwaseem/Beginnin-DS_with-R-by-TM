## Machine Learning Supervised

Machine learning concerns learning from data. You do not explicitly develop an algorithm for solving a particular problem. You use a generic algorithm and let it learn how to solve the problem from those.


* ## Supervised Learning
  Supervised learning is used when you have variables you want to predict using other variables--situations like linear regression where you have some input variables for example x and you want a model that predicts output variables y =f(x)
  
  
## Logistic Regression (Classification)
  
  Here We'll use the breast cancer data from the mlbench library.
  Ask if the clump thickness has an effect on the risk of a tumor being malignant. That is we want to see if we can predict the _Class_ variable from C1.
